<h2><u>CSS</u></h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve
content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
